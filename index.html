            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Zach Walker, and I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University. My early career was spent at Las Cumbres Observatory, where I played a key role in designing and building a global network of robotic telescopes. Currently, I work as a Staff Software Engineer at Appfolio.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Before diving into software engineering, I spent many years racing bicycles across various disciplines, with a primary focus on road racing. I continue to enjoy cycling, especially mountain biking, which remains a significant passion of mine.</p>
