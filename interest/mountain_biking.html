      <h2>Why I like mountain biking</h2>
      <p>
        I got started in mountain biking after riding my bike to school and back in elementary and middle school.  I was already interested in backpacking and had an itch to explore the trails in the area I grew up in.
        I could only get so far on my feet and didn't enjoy running as much as I enjoyed biking so I started exploring my local roads and trails by bike.  The freedom and adventure was addicting.
        By high school, I found friends with the same interests and soon got interested in not only exploring but seeing how far I could push myself.  I don't race much anymore
        but I still enjoy being outdoors on the trails.

          <tr>
            <td>What pressure should I run my tires at?</td>
            <td>There isn't one right answer, but some things to think about are, "How rocky is the trail", "How wide are your tires", "Are you running tubeless tires", "How heavy are you"  The wider your tires, the lower the pressure you need to ride.  Tubeless tires are more puncture resistant at lower pressures than tubed tires.  Trails that are rocky and jagged might require more pressure to avoid hitting the rim.  Lower pressure provides better traction but more rolling resistance.</td>
